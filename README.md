# Text Analytics for Business Insights

The project analyzes customer reviews from the weightloss.csv dataset to classify sentiments (positive or negative) using various models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning. Logistic Regression emerged as the most robust model, offering a balance between accuracy and generalization.

Key findings include:

Most reviews are positive (~77%).
Logistic Regression outperformed other models in ROC AUC and recall.
Deep Learning struggled with overfitting, and Naive Bayes had lower recall.
Recommendations focus on using sentiment insights to improve products, enhance customer support, and tailor marketing strategies. Limitations include data imbalance and ethical concerns in feedback analysis.
